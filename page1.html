<h1>PE Activites</h1>
<p class="random">PE isn't just running a mile every so weeks and doing whatever you want.
    In Physical Education, we play sports and do exercises Here are some examples:
    <br>
    We can play Basketball
    <br>
    We can play soccer
    <br>
    We can play flag football
    <br>
    And much more!
<p></p>
<h1>Basketball</h1>
<p class="activity">Basketball is a game that is often played inside between two teams of five players each. By attempting hurling the ball through the opposing team's goal,
    an elevated horizontal hoop and net known as a basket, each team attempts to score.
    Basketball, the only significant sport with purely American roots, was created by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or around December 1, 1891,
    at the International Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts (now Springfield College),
    where Naismith was a physical education instructor. </p>
<h1>Soccer</h1>
<p class="text">The sport's beginnings can be found in the ancient civilizations of China, Greece, and Rome, when the 'ball' was a rock or an animal hide filled with hair.
    Although it has been suggested that it dates back to ancient Mesoamerican societies, "football" or "soccer" as we know it today has its origins in nineteenth-century England.
    The concept of football migrated from England to Europe and over the Atlantic. Around 1874, August Hermann and Konrad Koch, two teachers, brought the game to Germany.
    Meanwhile, it's believed that immigrants introduced soccer to the country. In England, the first football association was established in 1863. The size and weight of the match-ball were standardized, and the rules were set, but they were constantly changing. Importantly, it was forbidden to carry the ball in your hands when playing rugby or association football (also known as soccer).

    Industrialization fueled the continuous rapid development of football into the 1900s. Following the advent of industry and other work-based clubs, public school teams gradually fell into a minority. The best players got financial rewards, and the general public, primarily working-class people, could purchase tickets to games.


    Worldwide, domestic leagues spread, with the English Football League serving as the first professional tier. Up until 1949, football was played in amateur leagues in Germany. Then, semi-professional leagues started to exist.
    The match-size ball's and weight were changed, and rules were developed but were constantly altered.
</p>
<h1>American Football(flag)</h1>
<p class="word">Early versions of association football and rugby football can be linked to the origins of American football. Both games have their genesis in many kinds of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, in which a football is kicked at a goal or kicked over a line, which in turn were founded on the variations of English public school football games deriving from medieval ball sports.

    Numerous significant differences between association football and rugby football led to the development of American football.
    Most notably, Walter Camp—a Yale University athlete and coach who is regarded as the "Father of American Football"—instituted the rule revisions.
    The line of scrimmage, down-and-distance rules, and the legality of the forward pass and blocking were a few of these significant innovations. [1][2][3] College coaches like Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Parke H. Davis, Knute Rockne, and Glenn "Pop" Warner made gameplay improvements in the late 19th and early 20th century to capitalize on the newly invented forward pass. As college football took over as the national sport in the United States throughout the first part of the 20th century, it gained in popularity. College teams played in bowl games, which are a tradition in college football.
    College football is still incredibly popular in the United States, helped by ferocious rivalries and vibrant traditions.In 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger signed a $500 ($15,080 in 2021 dollars) contract to play for the Allegheny Athletic Association versus the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, which is when professional football first emerged. The American Professional Football Association was established in 1920. Two years later, this league adopted the name National Football League (NFL), and over time it rose to prominence as the top American football league. Primarily a sport of Midwestern manufacturing cities in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.</p>


<h3><p class="pe">PE is supposed to be like recess in school, but except we workout, play sports or do physical activities. Physical Education is meant to keep a student on track with their Physical Health and make sure
    that nothing is wrong with the student. PE isn't always about running and playing sports. In PE we also learn about the history about sports. We take tests on both of these subjects.
</p></h3>




<h1>What are our tests?</h1>
<p class="pe">We usually have a test or two every unit. They consist of 2 different types of tests. The test variation depends on the unit we are in/studying.
    <br>
    1. Physical Tests
    <br>
    2. Unit Test
</p>
<h2>Physical tests</h2>
<p class="finish">These test are ones that pump your blood or will make you sweat. These are more common in some units because of the activites we do.
    Here are some examples
